Excluded are those who commit the five grave offenses and those who slander the right Dharma.”</em> <a href="https://sanmateobuddhisttemple.org/48-vows-of-bodhisattva-dharmakara/#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">(Source)</a></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3vylpi">Nembutsu can mean many different things depending on the practitioner and their associated school. It’s a central practice in Pure Land Buddhism and is utilized by a practitioner that aspires to be reborn in Amida’s buddha-field, or Pure Land. A buddha-field is a peaceful place where a Buddha teaches the dharma to all sentient beings within it. In Tientai, it’s used as a supplementary practice to cut through discursive thoughts. But even within Pure Land Buddhism, there’s varying interpretations on what nembutsu means. Some believe that it’s possible to be reborn in the Pure Land after just 10 recitations of Amida’s name if they are said in faith, and the rest are simply out of gratitude. Others believe that you have to recite continually throughout your life in order to develop the karmic conditions to remember the Pure Land at the time of death.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ccg7qd">Whatever you may believe, I think that there’s considerable potential in reciting Amida’s name. This is due to the power of mindfulness of the Buddha, which is the literal translation of nembutsu. Pingiya, a follower of Sakyamuni Buddha, but who was unable to be physically close to him due to his old age, stated:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fer1rm"><em>“I would not dwell apart from him even for a second, brahmin, from Gotama of Great Knowledge, Gotama of Great Intelligence, he who taught the Teaching to me, which is visible, not subject to time, the end of craving, beyond calamity, for which there is nowhere a likeness. I see him in my mind as though with the eye, (as I dwell) heedful night and day, brahmin. Revering him I make the night pass by, for that reason I think there is no (real) dwelling apart.”</em> <a href="https://ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Way-to-the-Beyond/The-Way-to-the-Beyond-Epilogue-2.htm" rel="nofollow">(Source)</a></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-v85k9n">That quote captivated me from the first time that I read it. I knew that there was great power in calling the Buddha to you. In the early days of the Buddha, there were many disciples that became stream-enterers just by hearing a sermon from the Buddha. The potential for learning would be substantial if he was constantly near us, even if not physically.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-w52pmz">This is due to our own Buddha Nature. Having Buddha Nature simply means that we all have the potential within us to become a Buddha. Bringing ourselves closer to the Buddha, inside or outside, would make that process significantly faster. On a mundane level, we can mirror our actions, thinking about how the Buddha would act in a certain situation, allowing his wisdom to reverberate through our minds and become realized through the choices that we make. On a deeper level, remembrance of the Buddha is a tantric process. When we are remembering the Buddha, we are purifying our deluded mind and remembering our inner nature. Although it’s not as elaborate as visualizing ourselves as a Buddha or bodhisattva, it’s still quite powerful.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1jc2jro">The practice can act as a base for everything else we do. We can purify the world around us when we carry nembutsu around with us in our day to day lives. We have many subtle and gross effects on the world. Even if we do not change our behavior greatly, chanting nembutsu can be of benefit to those around us. We carry the energy of the practice with us and others can pick up upon that energy. But if we strive to develop greater bodhicitta and develop further on the bodhisattva path, nembutsu can help ignite that great compassion within us and cause us to <em>act</em> differently, effecting great positive change upon the world. When I chant nembutsu, I feel the words soften my heart as I gradually begin to realize the interdependence of all phenomenon.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-124fwb6">If we want to change, we have to change our thoughts first. All our actions first stem from our thoughts. Our mindstream is fueled by karma and shapes the experiences that we have in the life to the next. If we are able to continually point our minds in a more wholesome direction instead of focusing on self-grasping, then we can create the conditions for us to become liberated or be born in the Pure Land if we are unable to awaken before our deaths. It’s easy to lose mindfulness and act in the way that we’ve always acted, so chanting nembutsu is a constant reminder to wake up.</p></div></article>
