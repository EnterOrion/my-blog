I felt compelled by Dante’s journey, where he starts out wandering lost in a dark woods to being united with God at the highest level of heaven. Obviously, Christianity and Buddhism have very different soteriologies, but I gained something from <em>Divine Comedy</em> nonetheless. Dante begins his journey being guided by Virgil, who acts as a symbol for human reason. Virgil shows him the nature of sin and the error of his worldly behavior, but the only way Dante actually makes it to heaven is through Beatrice, or divine grace. I felt inspired by what the force of grace can accomplish.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yardqr">After finishing the poem, I felt sad that there wasn’t anything that quite mirrors divine grace within Buddhism. But after learning more about Mahayana Buddhism, I discovered that grace does in fact play a role.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1m9x9np">The Buddha Amida is an important figure in many Mahayana and Vajrayana schools. His Pure Land is reachable to anyone who calls upon his name with faith. How could unvirtuous people reach his Pure Land? This is due to the fact one’s inner nature is never defiled. It’s like the sky, no matter how many clouds there may be, the blue sky still remains behind it. Amida can see beyond the external appearances of someone, and is there to aid whoever need his help.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-314j2p">It might be hard to stomach if you had an negative upbringing with Christianity and that was your introduction to religion. But there is no obligation to have faith in him. He remains as an option for those that are overwhelmed by the obstacles in the modern age and want a simple practice. There is power in calling his name and connecting yourself to a source of limitless compassion. There’s a softness that I’ve felt in my heart after reciting his mantra, a letting down of boundaries, knowing that nothing can separate you from this understanding, unconditional love.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1scckz1">As we work on developing Bodhicitta or compassion for all, we can bring this practice into our own lives. We may follow in the footsteps of the Never Disparaging Bodhisattva, a bodhisattva we learn about in chapter 20 of the Lotus Sutra. His practice is simple, for he doesn’t even read any sutras. But whoever he’s faced with, whether it may be a monk or laity, he predicts their future Buddhahood. When he’s slandered and eventually attacked by those that doubt him, he does not strike back nor does he lose heart. He assures them that he does not despise them. When he dies, he hears the words of the Lotus Sutra and his six senses are purified. He eventually goes on to be reborn as Sakyamuni Buddha.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-18hihju">Grace is a compassionate form of patience. The Lotus Sutra teaches that we are all Boddhisattvas on the path to Buddhahood, whether we recognize it or not. When the never Disparaging Bodhisattva bowed down each person that he met, he was bowing down to their ensured future buddhahood. If we are able to face everyone with this kind of humility, we can soften our actions and able to respond wholesomely in any kind of difficult situation. We can should still of course take appropriate action to remove ourselves from abusive situations, but in everyday scenarios, we can act in kinder ways, knowing that the person is lashing out from a temporarily deluded perspective, from a place of hurt.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-o7554v">When we start on making our way on a spiritual journey, or just simply a journey of becoming a better person, we’re often lost and confused at first, just like Dante. We first have to use reason to understand the causes of our suffering. But after we understand the conditions intellectually, we should remain open to the power of grace so that we can begin to feel a expansive, almost miraculous love that is free of attachment. Wisdom springs from compassion and we are able to see reality with fewer blinders on. Uplifted from our own suffering and mundane views, we can more easily extend our hand and help those who are still bogged down by suffering.</p></div></article>
