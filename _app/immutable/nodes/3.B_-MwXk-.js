Before

				philosophy. I&#39;ve always be drawn to the unknown, the esoteric, to what lies underneath the
				veil of the mundane. I then came across Buddhism and I fell in love with its practical
				approach to spirituality. It inspired me to work towards liberation within this very life.
				When I discovered Vajrayana, I was happy to have a practice that combined both the
				compassionate goal of eliminating suffering with the power and art of ritual. Similarly, I
