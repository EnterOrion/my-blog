It’s a central practice in Pure Land Buddhism and is utilized by a practitioner that aspires to be reborn in Amida’s buddha-field, or Pure Land. A buddha-field is a peaceful place where a Buddha teaches the dharma to all sentient beings within it. In Tientai, it’s used as a supplementary practice to cut through discursive thoughts. But even within Pure Land Buddhism, there’s varying interpretations on what nembutsu means. Some believe that it’s possible to be reborn in the Pure Land after just 10 recitations of Amida’s name if they are said in faith, and the rest are simply out of gratitude. Others believe that you have to recite continually throughout your life in order to develop the karmic conditions to remember the Pure Land at the time of death.",g,m,H="Whatever you may believe, I think that there’s considerable potential in reciting Amida’s name. This is due to the power of mindfulness of the Buddha, which is the literal translation of nembutsu.

Revering him I make the night pass by, for that reason I think there is no (real) dwelling apart.”</em> <a href="https://ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Way-to-the-Beyond/The-Way-to-the-Beyond-Epilogue-2.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a>',B,f,W="That quote captivated me from the first time that I read it.

Having Buddha Nature simply means that we all have the potential within us to become a Buddha. Bringing ourselves closer to the Buddha, inside or outside, would make that process significantly faster. On a mundane level, we can mirror our actions, thinking about how the Buddha would act in a certain situation, allowing his wisdom to reverberate through our minds and become realized through the choices that we make. On a deeper level, remembrance of the Buddha is a tantric process. When we are remembering the Buddha, we are purifying our deluded mind and remembering our inner nature.

We can purify the world around us when we carry nembutsu around with us in our day to day lives. We have many subtle and gross effects on the world. Even if we do not change our behavior greatly, chanting nembutsu can be of benefit to those around us. We carry the energy of the practice with us and others can pick up upon that energy. But if we strive to develop greater bodhicitta and develop further on the bodhisattva path, nembutsu can help ignite that great compassion within us and cause us to <em>act</em> differently, effecting great positive change upon the world.

All our actions first stem from our thoughts. Our mindstream is fueled by karma and shapes the experiences that we have in the life to the next.
